## Welcome to my GitHub Reposatory

I'm a master student at Nord Universitet with an interest in population genetics and bioinformatics. I'm currently working on a population genetics study on the scavenging amphipod species _Orchomenella obtusa_ in fjords surrounding Saltstraumen (Skjerstadfjorden and Saltenfjorden). Here I'm trying to determine if the sill separating the fjords are acting as a genetic barrer for the selected species (spoiler: it's not), by using amplicon sequences of the mitochondrial gene COI and rRNA gene 18S. </br>

Thesis link (expected to be out by may 2023): [Population genetic structure of the scavenging amphipod O. obtusa in a deep fjord system.](https://nordopen.nord.no/nord-xmlui/handle/11250/2731119)

## Master thesis: population genetics on _Orchomenella obtusa_

Step by step guide for the bioinformatics in my master thesis. </br>

Pipeline for COI and 18S amplicon sequence variant calling: <br/>
Quality control, adapter trimming, mapping, quality filtering, variant calling and creating multifasta files.
